                    <p>While working at Chipotle I experience working with many different peoples, but working at Dave and
                        Buster’s as a server introduced a whole new level of diversity. My daily responsibilities consist of
                        managing my tables, making sure my guest receive quality food and making sure the food they get is the
                        food they ordered. Doing all these different things gets a really overwhelming sometimes, but by far the
                        most difficult thing has been to learn how to successfully communicate with all the different kind of
                        people I meet on my shifts. I would describe myself as an introvert person, I have never been good at
                        interacting with new people and to easily create a connection with complete strangers. This all has
                        changed after starting working at Dave and Buster’s. I have learned to pick up on a person’s attitude the
                        way they talk and how they act, and thanks to my experience I’m able to find the best way to
                        communicate to them, making sure they leave with a good experience.

                    <div class="work-details">
                        <h3 class="work-position">Crew Member</h3>
                        <h3 class="time"><time datetime:"2014-08">August 2014</time> - <time datetime:"2017-08">August 2017</time></h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>As a crew member at Chipotle, I would do a lot of different things. During my first few months, I job
                        basically consisted of performing the simple task of the position. This talk could include charging the
                        guest as a cashier or cooking the food as a cook. As time when on and my overall knowledge increase,
                        my position became more of a shift leader. I never formally accepted this position due to my focus on
                        school, but during my shifts, I would assist the general manager in her team management
                        responsibilities. I would often be responsible for sending my coworkers on breaks, of making sure they
                        were doing their work correctly and efficiently and whatever else was necessary at the moment. I would
                        do these things while still performing all the task for my position for the day. My time with the company
                        also allowed me to become a trainer, making sure all new hires knew what was expected of them and
                        how to properly perform all their responsibilities.
