                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p>Operation Denenberg is a project part of the Informatics Capstone Project course. For this project, we
                        were assigned Professor Denenberg and Professor Ziv as our project sponsors. As our project sponsors,
                        both professors are to act as our clients, with the goal of providing us real word experience on the steps
                        necessary for the development of a new system. The overall goal of the project is to create a web
                        application that both professors will be able to use to better manage the Informatics CapStone Project
                        Course. This includes the ability to handle multiple profiles as well as creating new profiles and deleting
                        old ones,  to schedule first day presentations for all the course sponsors, to gather student and sponsor
                        data via surveys developed by us, and to create a web page for the course. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We are taking an agile approach to this projects, and currently, we stand on the second iteration of
                        mockups and prototypes for the application. The first set of mockups was already created based on the
                        requirements gathered by my team. 
                    </p>
