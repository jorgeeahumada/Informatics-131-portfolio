                    <p>This project is part of the Computer Game Development course at UCI. In this project, I and my team of
                        5 classmates are working on developing a game of our choice following the guidelines of good game
                        ign thought in the class, as well as marketing material for the game. For the project, we have chosen
                        to use the Unity game engine and to create a narrative based 2D puzzle platformer.
                    </p>
                    <p>Currently, this project is in the level development face in which Iâ€™m responsible for creating the third and
                        final level for the game. We are also currently working on the marketing materials and on the design
                        document required for the class.
                    </p>
                    <p>This project is expected to end in December 2017.</p>
