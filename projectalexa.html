                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p>Project Alexa was a projecting part of the Software System Design class. For this project, I and my team
                    assigned Professor Vanderhook as our sponsor. Professor Vanderhook came to the class with the idea of
                    creating an Amazon Alexa Skill for the School of Informatics at UCI, as a way to showcase our
                    department to the general public. For this project, I and my team worked a lot on user research since we
                    didn’t know who would use this application. After figuring out our users it was necessary to gather
                    requirements and start prototyping. Thanks to our agile approach to the project, we went through many
                    iterations of this process, each time refining the details of how the final product would look like.
                    </p>
                    <p>For this project, my focus was on the user experience design and the front end of the application. I did
                    multiple interview and surveys trying to better understand who the ideal users for the product would
                    be. At the end, we agreed that the department’s alumni would be the best option for the scope of our
                    project. Understanding the information we wanted to offer and the best way to access it was the
                    hardest part of the project since we needed queries that a human could easily ask but with enough
                    information so that the computer could easily understand it.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Notes</h1>
                    <p>Currently, the project is still in development under a different team. This team is trying to merge the UCI
                    Informatics Alexxa Skill and the UCI Sports Alexa Skill. The UCI Sports Alexa Skill was developed in
                    January 2017 by an unrelated team and was discovered by my team in the last few stages of our
                    development. Our sponsor decided to hold the publication of our project with the hope merging the two
                    applications to deliver a UCI Alexa Skill.
