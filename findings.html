                        <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                        <p>During this interviews, I asked questions related to
                        important information that an employer would find 
                        interesting from an applicant. Asking this types of 
                        questions allowed me to find the themes on which my 
                        portfolio should touch on and the define the importance
                        of each of this themes.</p>

                        <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
                        <p>The competitor analysis was great at helping me figure
                        out what sections would be important for my portfolio
                        . Most importantly I used this opportunity to see what
                        good design looks like and I tried to grab as much
                        design cues as possible from the other portfolios.

                        <p>The feature value matrix was the most helpful with
                        respect to the small details. Details suchs as what
                        contact info to add, or what specific aspects to
                        talk about, or if I should have a picture. I feel
                        that it was not as important when figuring out
                        the broad aspects that I wanted my portfolio to
                        touch on.</p>

                        <h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
                        <p>The feature prioritization diagram was not as helpful
                        as expected since I already had a fairly clear view
                        of what I wanted to include in the site and which
                        were the most important parts to me. The feature
                        prioritization diagram only helped to collaborated
                        my existing believes.</p>

                        <p>The user stories were great to figure out the logical
                        train of thought a user would have while visiting my
                        website. I especially enjoy the short nature of the
                        stories since they forced me to be clear of what i
                        want to archive. DOing this allow me to realized
                        some aspects that my website lack with regards to
                        the way the information is being display.</p>

                        <h4>Cognitive Walkthrought</h4>
                        <p>I feel that the cognitive walkthrough wasnâ€™t as helpful
                        due to the fact that I was not able to create questions
                        that really pushed the user to explore the website.
                        Overall I got similar responses from all my
                        walkthroughts but the problems that were notice are
                        big enough that still makes me feel satisfy about
                        performing the cognitive walkthroughs.

                        were trying to gather, sadly I was not able to get
                        a big enough of a sample to really make any claims.
                        In a similar manner i felt that all users were 
                        trying to be polite about their feedback and that 
                        inhibited them from being able to give clear and 
                        honest feedback.</p>

                <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    I feel that the cognitive walkthroughs game me the most
                    opportunity for grow since it allow me to find small 
                    details with the content that, if improve, could create 
                    a much better user experience. Overall I found that the 
                    information on my website was not being properly display. 
                    It seem to be the correct information but the design choice 
                    of using long descriptive paragraphs was not working really 
                    well and actually turned away the user from reading the content 
                    at all. Adding to the difficulty of finding the information the 
                    user requires. The tites for the different taps were not as clear 
                    as I had hoped. I tried hard to keep the tiles short and descriptive, 
                    but it seems that this approach was not descriptive enough and often 
                    left users wondere the details of the information within each page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the cognitive walkthroughs the user stories gave
                    me the most information with regards to the major
                    usability problems of my website. Even though the 
                    stories were written using my own perspective and 
                    ideas, the short nature of them forced me to reduce 
                    my ideas to the basics, which then showed me some 
                    shortcomings on the information in my website. I found 
                    in many occasions the information in my website is not 
                    explicitly stated and the user has to look for their 
                    answers. I was fast to realized that my user based 
                    seemed unlikely to search for anything on my website, 
                    or to even spend more than a couple of seconds looking 
                    for the information they need.  
                </p>
                <P>
                    While creating the user stories, I was also to notice 
                    a design aspect that had nothing to do with the stories 
                    themselves. While exploring my website to find 
                    information relevant that I could include in the 
                    stories, I found that even I was having difficulty 
                    navigating the site. I feel that this was mostly do to 
                    the little inconsistencies between pages, and how the 
                    overall look and feel of the site is not shared between 
                    pages, and each pages feels like it stands on its own 
                    with outside links to other pages, instead of it all 
                    feeling as part of one application.

                <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    The first thing I plan to do is to change the taps names, at 
                    this point i feel that it would be best to change the name 
                    for both the Home and Contact me tap, and to try to merge the 
                    Work experience and the projects tap into one. Ideally I 
                    would like to add the contact information to the bottom of 
                    the page and to keep the portfolio to two main taps, but do 
                    to the difficulty I had setting up a footer for all the 
                    pages, I believe it would be best to leave on itâ€™s on tap for 
                    right now.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would also like to add functionality to the contact 
                    section, adding links to my email, linked in account, 
                    facebook, and github. One functionality that I just saw in 
                    class that I personality really appreciate in other websites 
                    is the copy to clipboard option for the email. At the moment, 
                    I do not know how this feature would be implemented, so I 
                    will leave it out the website, but it is a nice feature that 
                    I would like to have.   
                </p>
                <P>
                    Another important thing is adding subtitles to each one of 
                    the pages. I feel that this is necessary to allow the user to 
                    better navigate the pages and to easily find the information 
                    they need. Adding to this concept, I will be adding a skills 
                    section, probably within the experience pages, since I feel 
                    that the website does a poor job at showcasing my abilities 
                    as a programmer and all the different tool Iâ€™m proficient 
                    with. 
                </P>
                <p>
                    The biggest pain point of the website, and sadly one the I 
                    will not be able to fix within the scope of this project is 
                    the overall design of the website. As a UX designer I see 
                    many shortcomings of the overall functionality of the site 
                    and I believe that I know how to solve most of them. 
                    Unfortunately, my programming skills and my HTML knowledge 
                    does not match the expectations I have for the site. For me 
                    to accomplish this goal I will spend winter break 
                    experimenting with Bootstrap, enabling to improve the design 
                    of my site and also to apply this new knowledge on another 
                    class the I know will require me to be able to utilize this 
                    tool within others.
