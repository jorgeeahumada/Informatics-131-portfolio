                <p>My name is Jorge Eduardo Ahumada Hern&aacutendez, I’m an Informatics Student at the University of 
                    California Irvine. I’m in my 5th year and expecting to graduate this upcoming March 2018, with a B.S. in
                    Informatics and a specialization in Human and Computer Interaction. I didn’t start college with this
                    major in mind, but life always takes you in different, unexpected, paths, and I’m glad it did. I would say
                    that the thing I love the most about my major is how it focuses on people, on what they think, on what
                    they do, and on what they don’t do. I’ve always been interested in this, I even wanted to become a
                    psychology major at one time. That is why I feel like Informatics ended up being a perfect fit for me. 
                    During my coursework, I’ve learned that I love to design applications. It’s really rewarding when you
                    know that you’re working on a quality product and that you are affecting your users’ daily lives, even if it
                    is just in a small way.  
                </p>
                <p>The same thing also pushes my interest outside of school. I love to cook, and I just love food in general.
                    The way I see it when I cook for people is like I’m creating the perfect product. Whatever I make must be
                    liked by everyone that is eating and more often than not, that is fairly picky people. Every time I’m
                    cooking at home I get an “I don’t like vegetables” from my little sister, an “It has to be healthy” from my
                    mom, an “I don’t like beef” from my girlfriend, and many more request that I have to take into
                    consideration. I have to keep in mind what everyone likes to eat and try my best to deliver. Nonetheless,
                    sometimes the execution doesn’t leave up to the expectations, but it normally does.
